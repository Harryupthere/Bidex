                NFT MARKETPLACE. Bidex NFT has created the Marketplace to enable
                fans and collectors to buy original, authentic units of data on
                a blockchain representing a digital file (including, without
                limitation, digital artwork) (such units, “Non-Fungible Tokens”
                or “NFTs”). NFTs available for sale on the Marketplace have
                been: (i) created by an artist that has engaged with Bidex NFT
                for such purposes (the “Artist”) and the digital file and
                artwork associated therewith (the “Artwork”) features a certain
                athlete or athletes (the “Athlete” or “Athletes”), musician or
                musicians (the "Athlete" or Athletes"), or (ii) created and
                minted by an artist or collective unaffiliated with Bidex NFT (a
                “Third Party Seller”) and is being sold on Bidex NFT’s
                Marketplace. Please visit our “About” and “FAQ” pages to learn

              <h3>PURCHASE AND SALE PROCESS</h3>
              <p>
                BIDDING IN AN AUCTION PURCHASING NFTs. NFTs will be made
                available for sale via an auction process or by your selection
                of the NFT “Buy Now” option, as applicable to each NFT displayed
                and available for sale on the Marketplace.
                <br></br>In order to participate in an auction, you can place an
                incremental bid during the auction by clicking on the “Bid”
                button. Once submitted, all bids are final and cannot be
                amended, reduced, retracted or revoked. Bidex NFT is not
                responsible for any errors you make in bidding. By participating
                in an auction, you also represent and warrant that any bids you
                place are not the product of any collusive or other
                anti-competitive agreement and are not unlawful or otherwise
                inconsistent with federal and state antitrust law. You will
                receive an email notification if you are outbid by another
                bidder. If that happens, you will have the option to place
                additional bids on the NFTs, provided that the auction is still
                open.
                <br></br>
                Instead of placing multiple, incremental bids, you can choose to
                place a “maximum bid” on the NFTs in a Bidex NFT auction.
                Placing a maximum bid does not mean you will end up paying the
                full amount of your maximum bid. The system will recognize your
                maximum bid and will place consecutive, incremental bids on your
                behalf up to but not exceeding the amount of your “maximum bid”
                in response to other bids placed; provided, that such “maximum
                bid” will only win the auction to the extent that it is higher
                than the next highest bid in such auction by more than the
                applicable minimum bid increment. If your maximum bid has been
                outbid by other bidders, you will receive notification and will
                have the option to submit an increased maximum bid. You may
                increase your maximum bid at any time during the timed auction.
                Once submitted, you cannot lower a maximum bid.
                <br></br>
                At the close of a timed auction, the highest bid accepted on the
                NFTs will be the successful bid and that bidder will become the
                buyer of the NFTs (the “Buyer”), unless special circumstances
                require Bidex NFT to exercise its discretion to void any bids. A
                contract for sale of the NFTs is formed between Bidex NFT and
                the highest bidder on the NFTs at the time the auction closes,
                and the Buyer will enter into a Smart Contract with Bidex NFT or
                the seller of the NFTs, as applicable, following the time of the
                winning bid. Winning bidders will be notified and contacted by
                email after the auction has closed.
                <br></br>
                If you believe that Bidex NFT has accepted the successful bid in
                error, you must provide a written notice detailing your claim
                within three (3) business days of the date of the auction of the
                NFTs. Bidex NFT will consider such claim in good faith. If in
                the exercise of our discretion under this paragraph, Bidex NFT
                decides after the auction is complete, to cancel the sale of the
                NFTs, or re-offer or sell the NFTs, we will notify the
                successful bidder no later than the 7th calendar day following
                the sale of the NFTs. Bidex NFT ’s decision in the exercise of
                this discretion is final. This paragraph does not in any way
                prejudice Bidex NFT’s ability to cancel the sale of the NFTs
                under any provision of these Terms & Conditions, including any
                other rights of cancellation set forth herein or under
                applicable law. Bidex NFT has no liability to bidders or Buyers
                for any such actions which it may take during the auction. If
                any dispute arises after the Bidex NFT auction, our sale record
                is conclusive.

                <br></br>
                <h5> Buy Now</h5>
                In certain cases, Bidex NFT may make available the opportunity
                to purchase NFTs at a certain price determined by Bidex NFT by
                clicking the “Buy Now” button for certain NFTs. All “Buy Now”
                submissions are final and non-refundable.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                <h5> Binding Nature of Bids and Purchases</h5>
                By placing an order to purchase NFTs, you accept personal
                liability to pay the Purchase Price (upon purchasing such NFTs),
                plus all other applicable charges. The sale will be consummated
                via Smart Contract, which shall include, without limitation,
                certain terms governing resale royalties, and use limitations of
                the NFTs and associated Artwork. You are solely responsible for
                understanding the terms of the Smart Contract as may be made
                available for review on the blockchain.

              <h3>PURCHASE AND PAYMENT.</h3>
              <h5>Calculating the Total Purchase Price</h5>
              <p>
                If you are the successful bidder and/or Buyer of the NFTs, you
                agree to pay us: with respect to an auction, the Hammer Price of
                the NFTs, and with respect to a “Buy Now” purchase, the purchase
                price accepted for the applicable NFT (in each case, the “Sale
                Price”), plus with respect to either transaction, the Buyer’s
                Premium and any applicable sales tax (together, the “Purchase
                Price”). The Hammer Price is the final, highest bid accepted for
                the NFTs when Bidex NFT closes bidding during an auction. The
                Buyer’s Premium is the commission Bidex NFT charges the Buyer
                and is calculated on the Sale Price of the NFTs on such terms
                set forth on each particular NFT sales landing page. Sales Tax,
                Use Tax, Excise Tax, and other taxes, including any taxes
                applicable to the sale or purchase of NFTs, are payable in
                accordance with applicable law, and you further acknowledge and
                agree that it is your responsibility to pay any such taxes that
                are due on the purchase of the NFTs whether arising but not
                collected at the time of sale or applicable through retroactive
                and applicable legislation.
              </p>{" "}
              <h5>Software Integration</h5>
              <p>
                You hereby agree and acknowledge that you have created, or shall
                have created prior to purchasing NFTs, a Transak Account, and
                that you shall be subject to all terms, conditions and
                obligations of Transak (or such other processor) users. You
                further agree and acknowledge that upon creating a Transak
                Account such account shall be deemed a “Connected Account” under
                the Transak Company agreement located here:
                <a href=""> https://transak.com/terms-of-service;</a> provided,
                that by creating an account on the Marketplace, you hereby
                expressly authorize Bidex NFT to integrate Transak for the
                purposes of facilitating the transactions set forth herein. In
                support thereof, you further authorize Transak to send any and
                all notices and forms, including without limitation, tax
                invoices, to Bidex NFT with respect to any payment amounts that
                are withheld upon transfer for purposes making applicable tax
                withholdings. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that
                Bidex NFT receives such forms or notices from Transak, Bidex NFT
                shall promptly make all such documentation available to you on
                your Marketplace account.
              </p>
              <h5>Payment and Delivery</h5>
              <br></br>
              <p>
                You are required to pay for the purchased NFTs immediately upon
                clicking “Buy Now” or immediately following the close of the
                auction, as applicable. Payments must be made to Bidex NFT by
                the invoiced party in NZD, via Visa and MasterCard. All sales
                are final and nonrefundable. In no event shall Bidex NFT accept
                returns for refund or exchange. Whether you make a purchase via
                “Buy Now” or otherwise win an auction to purchase NFTs, you
                authorize Bidex NFT and our third-party service providers to
                immediately charge your selected payment method for all amounts
                presented to you at checkout.
              </p>{" "}
              <br></br>
              <p>
                Title in the purchased NFTs will not pass until Bidex NFT has
                received the Purchase Price for the NFT in full and cleared
                funds. Bidex NFTs is not obliged to release the NFTs to you
                until title in the NFTs has passed and appropriate
                identification has been provided, and any earlier release does
                not affect the passing of title or your unconditional obligation
                to pay the Purchase Price.
              </p>{" "}
              <br></br>
              <p>
                To transfer title in the NFTs to you, Bidex NFT will transfer
                the NFTs to your account on an NFT-only wallet hosted on the
                Marketplace, which wallet shall, in all cases, exclusively hold
                NFTs and not, for the avoidance of doubt, cryptocurrencies (your
                “Digital Wallet”). Bidex NFT shall not be responsible for
                transferring or facilitating the transfer of such NFT to any
                other wallet. Risk will transfer to you immediately upon Vault
                Media transfer of title of the NFTs to you by sending it to your
                Digital Wallet, and you are thereafter responsible for secure
                storage of the NFTs. You agree that Bidex NFT may require you to
                follow a security protocol to ensure that NFTs are safely
                received by you. You understand and agree that failure to comply
                with these conditions may result in a failure to access your
                NFTs.
              </p>
              <h5>Resale Royalties</h5>
              <br></br>
              <p>
                The NFT and any further versions of the Artwork generated by the
                NFTs (“Children”) are subject to resale royalties on any
                subsequent resales of the NFTs. On any subsequent resale of the
                NFTs or of its Children, resale royalties shall automatically be
                paid to Bidex NFT, Artist, Musician and Athlete, as applicable,
                on terms set forth in the applicable Smart Contract governing
                the sale transaction. Other resale royalties and transaction
                duties imposed by law may also apply in relation to such
                resales.

                Without prejudice to any rights that Bidex NFT, the Artist
                and/or Athletes may have, if you fail to pay the Purchase Price
                for the NFTs in cleared funds within seven (7) days of purchase,

                <h5> DESCRIPTIONS OF NFTs</h5>
                <br></br> Bidex NFT makes no representation and provides no
                warranty whatsoever in relation to the nature, description,
                operation, use, fitness, utility or compatibility with digital
                platforms and/or software for purpose of the NFT digital file,
                either now or in the future. For the avoidance of doubt, Vault
                Media or Third Party Seller, as may be applicable (the “NFT
                Seller”), is not selling any ownership rights in, or to the
                copyright to, the Artwork related to the NFTs. The NFT Seller is
                selling the ownership rights to the NFTs only. Prospective
                bidders or Buyers acknowledge these limitations of Bidex NFT’s
                descriptions (or Third Party Seller’s descriptions, if
                applicable) and accept responsibility for carrying out
                inspections and investigations to satisfy themselves as to the
                descriptions of the NFTs being offered for sale. Descriptions,
                online or otherwise, of the NFTs may include a description of
                the NFTs, their functionality, the history of ownership of the
                NFTs (also referred to as their “provenance”), as well as any
                exhibition history, and references to the NFT or the digital
                file to which the NFTs relate in art publications. While Vault
                Media is careful in the cataloguing process, provenance,
                exhibition, and literature references may not be exhaustive,
                particularly in respect of a sale made by a Third Party Seller.
                Some or all of the above descriptions may also be stored in the
                blockchain ledger of transactions relating to the NFTs and Vault
                Media has no control over, and accepts no responsibility for,
                the transactions recorded or displayed in the blockchain in
                relation to the NFTs. Preview photographs, videos, and
                illustrations are for identification purposes only, cannot be
                used as precise indications of size, and do not necessarily
                convey full information as to the condition of the Artwork
                represented by the NFTs. Bidex NFT makes every effort to
                describe the NFTs and Artwork in the sale as accurately as
                possible. Where colors are displayed, the colors you see will,
                however, depend on the resolution of your monitor or of your
                mobile device..

                  Bidex NFT cannot guarantee that your monitor’s, or your mobile
                  device’s, display of any color will reflect accurately the
                  color of the items described. Information provided in respect
                  to descriptions of the NFTs, the Artwork, any condition report
                  (where available), or link to the blockchain, whether written
                  or oral, is not a representation of fact but rather a
                  statement of opinion held by Bidex NFT.

                <p>
                  <h5> CONDITION</h5>You agree that all NFTs are sold “as is”
                  and that the Artwork (and associated digital file) is in the
                  condition that it is in at the time of the sale and that Vault
                  Media shall in no event be responsible for the condition or
                  intended functionality of any NFT sold on the Platform,
                  whether sold directly by Bidex NFT or pursuant to a sale made
                  by a Third Party Seller. Descriptions, online or otherwise, of
                  the NFTs or the Artwork or links to the blockchain may include
                  references to condition and/or intended functionality. Such
                  references, though, do not amount to a full description of
                  condition and/or functionality. The absence of reference to
                  the condition and/or functionality of the NFTs or the Artwork
                  in their descriptions does not imply that the NFTs or the
                  Artwork is free from faults or imperfections, and you
                  acknowledge and agree to take all necessary care in inspecting
                  information available on the blockchain or otherwise,
                  regarding the NFTs, prior to Shopping. You hereby acknowledge
                  and agree that our staff are not information technology or
                  data experts, and that by Shopping, you accept that NFTs and
                  blockchains in general are subject to inherent technological
                  risks which may affect their performance now or in the future
                  (including, without limitation, broadband and other internet
                  capacity constraints, corporate firewalls, errors in the
                  quality or display of digital images, errors in software and
                  other technical problems) and Bidex NFT does not accept
                  liability for any such difficulties or errors. Bidex NFT makes
                  no representations or warranties in relation to the condition,
                  performance, security, quality, representations and
                  warranties, or terms of the NFTs, the Artwork, or any smart
                  contract memorializing a sale transaction on a blockchain (a
                  “Smart Contract”). Bidex NFT accepts bids on NFTs and
                  otherwise facilitates the transfer and sale of NFTs on the
                  basis that Buyers have fully satisfied themselves as to both
                  the condition of the NFTs and the accuracy of its description
                  prior to bidding or purchasing the NFTs.
